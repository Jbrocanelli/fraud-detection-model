# Fraud Detection System - Machine Learning Model

## Overview
This repository contains the Machine Learning Model for a Fraud Detection System, developed to identify fraudulent financial transactions. Currently, only the model has been implemented and trained. It is capable of predicting potential fraudulent transactions based on a dataset of past transaction records.

## Current Status

### Completed:
- Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.
- Model is trained and evaluated with the provided dataset.

### In Progress:
- Integration of the model into a larger system (e.g., API or web application).
- Real-time transaction processing and deployment to production.
- Full system implementation and testing.
